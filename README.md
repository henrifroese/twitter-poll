## Using a neural network to predict political affiliation of (German) twitter users


The [notebook](https://github.com/hf2000510/twitter_poll/blob/master/twitter_pol_notebook.ipynb) explains and showcases the main parts of the project, take a look at that first - the "clean" and ready-to-use code is in separate python files that are explained/documented here.

The aim of this project is to train a neural network to predict a Twitter user's political affiliation from his or her tweets. The network showcased here achieves an accuracy of around 82-87%. Further applications of the developed network are:
* Classifying news articles by predicting the political affiliation of those who retweet and like them
* Looking at if/how "filter bubbles" develop by analyzing user's social graph through the network
