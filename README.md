# Using a neural network to predict the political affiliation of (German) twitter users
- [This notebook](https://github.com/hf2000510/twitter_poll/blob/master/twitter_pol_notebook.ipynb) explains and showcases the project (data collection, cleaning, different approaches, training, ...).
- The trained model can be used freely. If you only want to use the model, [this notebook](https://github.com/hf2000510/twitter-poll/blob/master/twitter_pol_prediction_showcase.ipynb) explains all you need. (If you only want the model, it's [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-1qIYDXzAMfUhH0Z57wBsaX_PGljNPbs); it takes standard BERT input and outputs probabilities in order linke-greens-spd-fdp-cdu-afd). Read the notebook for more info.
- If your're interested in the data, the lists of German twitter usernames by party are in one of the first cells. Read through the notebook to see how to programatically download the specific users' tweets.
