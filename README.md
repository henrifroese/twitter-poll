# Predicting the political views of (German & US) Twitter users from their Tweets with Deep Learning
- [This notebook](https://github.com/henrifroese/twitter-poll/blob/master/twitter_pol_notebook_final_DE.ipynb) explains and showcases the project (data collection, cleaning, different approaches, training, ...) for German Twitter users and politics.
- [This notebook](https://github.com/henrifroese/twitter-poll/blob/master/twitter_pol_notebook_final_US.ipynb) is essentially the same, but with US users and US politics.
- The trained model can be used freely. If you only want to use the model, [this notebook](https://github.com/hf2000510/twitter-poll/blob/master/twitter_pol_prediction_showcase.ipynb) explains all you need for the German model.
- If your're interested in the data, the lists of German/US twitter usernames by party are in one of the first cells in the respective notebook. Read through the notebook to see how to programatically download the specific users' tweets.
